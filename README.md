This is a Cost Analysis of using Solar energy vis-a-vis buying Electricity from the Main Power Grid.
Additionally,it goes further to project the benefits of having a battery on the account of storing excess power generated from Solar.
In the end,through the analaysis,an empirical(evidence based)decision is made,on the profitability/benefit of using Solar versus consuming power from the main grid
and under what conditions would make this beneficial.
