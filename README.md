**OBJECTIVE**

To establish the **Cost Benefit** of using Solar vis-a-vis purchasing Electricity from the Power Grid.

**Methodology**

Determined electricty prodution generated by Solar through aggegate prodcution per hour,from midnight 0000hrs to 2300hrs
Also,determined power consumption by aggregating consumption as influnced by demand.
That is,Solar generetd and Electricty consumption.

From these established metrics,we establish the amount of Elcetricty this cosnumer will purchase from the Electricty provider,
both hourly and in aggregateto offset the insufficient production from Solar.

Also,from these the hourly production data against consumption,we establish the amount of Solar that is generated and not consumed.
We aggregate this unused solar energy as 'Excess solar'.


**Modelling**

Using Excess solar,we aggregate this unutilised energy,hour on hour and 'store' it to a battery.
From the charge level of this prototype battery,we establish the true excess solar energy against hourly electricity consumption inorder to test the viability of Solar as viable anlternative to purchasing power the Main Grid.
